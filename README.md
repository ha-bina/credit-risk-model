# "credit scoring understanding" 
Credit scoring is widely understood to have immense potential to assist in the economic growth of the world economy. Additionally, it is a valuable tool for improving financial inclusion; credit access for individuals and micro, small, and medium enterprises; and efficiency.
The use of credit scoring and the variety ofscoring have increased significantly in recent years owing to better access to a wider variety of data, increased computing power, greater demand for improvements in efficiency, and economic growth.
Furthermore, the application of credit scoring has evolved from traditional decision making of accepting or rejecting an application for credit to inclusion of other facets of the credit process such as the pricing of financial services to reflect the risk profile of the consumer or business and the setting of credit limits. Credit scoring is also used to determine minimum levels of regulatory and economic capital, support customer relationship
management, and, in certain countries, solicit prospective consumers and businesses with offers.
The methods used for credit scoring have increased in sophistication in recent years. They have evolved from traditional statistical techniques to innovative methods such as artificial intelligence, including machine learning algorithms such as random forests,  radient boosting, and deep neural networks. In some cases, the adoption of innovative
techniques has also broadened the range of data that may be considered relevant for credit scoring models and decisions.
The Basel II Accords emphasis on risk measurement, particularly through its Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approaches, significantly heightens the need for interpretable and well-documented models. This is because regulatory compliance under Basel II requires financial institutions to not only assess credit, market, and operational risks accurately, but also to demonstrate and justify how these risks are measured and managed. Basel II’s focus on robust, explainable risk measurement systems drives the need for models that are not only statistically sound but also easily understood, traceable, and defendable qualities that are critical under regulatory, operational, and business lenses.
A proxy variable is necessary Supervised learning requires a known outcome variable. Without a default label, we cannot teach the model to distinguish between risky and safe borrowers. In many cases, default events may be rare, delayed, or not recorded at all. A proxy (e.g., payment delinquency over 90 days, charge-offs, or loan restructuring) provides a measurable, timely outcome. Proxies often represent earlier signs of financial distress, enabling proactive credit decisions before actual default occurs.
The main risks are regulatory risk,Label Mismatch,Bias in Decision-Making and weakening model performance over time.
In regulated environments like banking, interpretability, auditability, and stability often outweigh marginal gains in performance. Simple models are typically preferred for regulatory capital estimation, while complex models may be more suitable for internal risk ranking, collections prioritization, or marketing, provided their predictions can be well justified and monitored. The ideal approach involves combining both through hybrid modeling or using complex models for insights and simple models for final decisions.
# Credit Risk Model

This repository contains a pipeline for credit risk modeling, including data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The project is designed for transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd credit-risk-model
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

#### Data Exploration

- Open and run `notebooks/1.0-eda.ipynb` for exploratory data analysis.
- The notebook expects raw data at `data/raw/data.csv`.

#### Data Processing

- Use `notebooks/processing.ipynb` to preprocess data and generate features for modeling.

#### Model Training & Evaluation

- Training and evaluation scripts are in `src/`.
- Example workflow:
    ```python
    from src.data_processing import preprocess_transaction_data
    from src.utils import evaluate_model, print_evaluation_metrics, save_evaluation_metrics
    # Load and preprocess data, train model, evaluate, and save metrics
    ```

#### API

- The FastAPI app in `api/` can be run to serve predictions:
    ```sh
    uvicorn api.main:app --reload
    ```

### Testing

- Run all unit tests:
    ```sh
    pytest tests/
    ```

### Continuous Integration

- GitHub Actions workflow runs linting and tests on every push to `main`.
